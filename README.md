# camoufox-free

A fork of [Camoufox](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox), the Firefox build
that spoofs device fingerprints in C++. For what Camoufox is, its features and
how to build it, read [upstream's README](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox#readme).

This fork follows upstream `main` and currently pins Firefox 158.0 in
[`browser/upstream.sh`](browser/upstream.sh). It releases its own builds.
Everything it adds is listed below; fixes are offered upstream.

> [!NOTE]
> Under development. Test a release against your own targets before relying on it.

## What this fork adds

### Rendering as the claimed OS

For an identity whose OS is not the host's. Offered upstream in
[#896](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/pull/896).

- **Per-script font fallback** follows the claimed OS's tables and `font.*`
  defaults, so Thai, emoji, Mongolian and other scripts draw with the faces
  stock Firefox uses there. ([7c8e6a9](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/7c8e6a9d8b3312846c26fe8e31984c10a1d3d6c6))
- **Native headless WebGL** uses Mesa EGL and llvmpipe with `DISPLAY` unset,
  so WebGL and WebGL2 return real rendering contexts and still report the
  identity's pinned GPU. Xvfb is not required. See
  [Native headless WebGL](docs/headless-webgl.md).
- **DirectWrite line metrics** for a Windows identity (`fonts:metrics`), so
  line boxes match Windows instead of FreeType. ([c8cd204](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/c8cd20423c9640bbb381fc33a293c33ccbbddadf), [6023d01](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/6023d01bd194ad38e1fae7a3660c0c02d5c200fa))
- **Subpixel glyph positions** for a Windows or macOS identity, so text and
  form-control widths match those OSes. ([806329a](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/806329ab64dcf271802b672b57cae1ca7ac34ec6))
- **macOS UCS4 cmaps** are read for a macOS identity, so Geneva, Apple Symbols
  and Heiti render instead of sitting unused in the font list. ([82092da](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/82092dac9937b7d87fd62cd64c84a4197f32ee0b))
- **Codecs:** `canPlayType()` and `mediaCapabilities.decodingInfo()` both
  answer as the claimed OS, with Windows' hardware codecs. ([8fa6bd8](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/8fa6bd86d751734ce2bd209aab4e01392aa7580e))
- **Windows system colours** (Highlight, AccentColor, dialog) instead of the
  host's GTK theme. ([51dfed2](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/51dfed22ff39a1bca9e1ab982b97b8c44292c534))

### Other browser fixes

- **Large per-context values cross content processes.** Firefox does not sync a
  string pref over 4 KiB. Font and voice lists over 3 KiB are stored in chunks
  and reassembled from a generation header, so every content-process page and
  worker sees the context's own lists. A context font list replaces the launch
  list instead of intersecting it.
- **Context identity and proxy settings stay isolated.** Proxy credentials are
  isolated per container/private context, and a NewContext behind a proxy
  derives its WebRTC IP, timezone, locale and geolocation from that proxy's
  exit IP. Context viewports are bounded by the shared launch window.
- **Authenticated SOCKS5 proxies.** Playwright rejects SOCKS5 credentials
  before Juggler receives the proxy, so the launchers pass them through an
  endpoint-scoped launch environment and Juggler builds the proxy with
  `newProxyInfoWithAuth`. `socks5h` resolves names at the proxy. A setup error
  fails the request closed instead of falling back to the host's direct
  connection. Ported from liasica's [2f0be40](https://github.com/liasica/camoufox/commit/2f0be400e53b88bb9b00b3faf2356503ae9dbfab).
- **Fontconfig memo keyed by context.** One context's font allow-list no longer
  answers for other contexts in the same content process. Offered upstream in
  [#942](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/pull/942). ([6950149](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/6950149e920820710122e176ab66bd14d66db4c4))
- **Storage puts sync from the main thread**, so a put from a worker cannot
  crash a content process. Upstream dropped it because nothing triggers it
  today. ([b481348](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/b481348b58bf4a6b6bcd4f59a7f348fe32720212))
- **EME on for Windows identities.** With EME off, Firefox's "EME has been
  preffed off" error is one only Linux Firefox gives. ([1a43e61](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/1a43e61878b66ffa66334ee30c38a846842a0f19))
- **uBlock Origin doesn't hold requests** while it compiles its lists on a
  fresh profile (1–45 s). Requests in the first seconds go unfiltered.
  Upstream keeps the hold. ([41a9903](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/41a9903048c011b9fc9aa38aa9786d72d922a94d))
- **Network and automation protocol fixes.** Routed requests keep Firefox's
  original header order; UA, Accept-Language and per-scheme Accept-Encoding
  stay coherent; DNT and context locale are stable across navigation.
  WebSocket close arguments follow Firefox 158, and a failed promise-reaction
  attach rejects immediately instead of leaving Juggler hanging.
- **Per-context locale follows every scope.** A context's locale reaches
  `Intl`, `navigator.languages`, Accept-Language q-values, isolated worlds,
  dedicated/shared/service workers, AudioWorklets, requests without a browsing
  context, and built-in strings. Changing one context does not overwrite the
  launch locale or another context.
- **Pinned viewport and GPU behaviour are deterministic.** A config that pins
  `window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight` no longer deadlocks viewport updates.
  Explicit `webgl_config` replaces a preset's GPU as one complete pair in both
  launchers.
- **Corrupt font data fails closed.** A damaged `groups.json` refuses the launch
  instead of widening the scan to every OS's fonts. Windows font-unit rates and
  essential-font aliases are regenerated from the pinned fpgen model.
- **Launcher failures are bounded and explicit.** Transient downloads retry
  429/5xx/connection failures, and the host GPU probe has a 30-second deadline
  that reports the executable and display it was probing instead of hanging.

### Kept here after upstream declined

- **`gpu_passthrough=True`.** A Linux container on Windows can render on the
  host's real GPU through WSL's D3D12 driver while claiming Windows Firefox on
  that GPU. The canvas stays uncovered, and WebGPU reports Windows' adapter
  limits. ([aaf96d7](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/aaf96d7a94641757d88fff876dcd8b17d13b689a), [f7c27c8](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/f7c27c8681e55480b6f3f434b7a2e0e3a535598d))
- **`humanize_engine="mousecrack"`.** A second cursor engine, using
  [mousecrack](https://github.com/puffinsoft/mousecrack)'s trained network.
  Cursory stays the default. ([529a730](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/529a730125862d65dd6085e05c398ae9bd2aabb4))
- **First humanized move** starts just inside the page's top edge, not at
  (0, 0). ([33f01dc](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/33f01dc5cacc9cc58aa1cf0e41a132a7e001ae9c))
- **Geolocation accuracy.** IP-derived positions are rounded to the database's
  precision and carry a city-scale accuracy in whole metres, instead of
  14 decimals and 6e-10 m. ([bb7bc29](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/bb7bc29fd5cf77167cbeffe7fbfbd1d9d0b63b10), [9954eac](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/9954eac531391b0ae56917dccab150dfe81fc568))

### Build, releases and defaults

- **uBlock Origin is resolved once per release and bundled verified.** The
  release workflow passes AMO's newest uBO release to packaging as
  `CAMOUFOX_UBO`; `browser/scripts/fetch-ubo.py` checks its SHA-256, add-on ID
  and version, then stages it under `addons/UBO/`. Bundle updates stay disabled,
  and the selected filter lists are pinned to the ten lists inside that bundle,
  so a first run downloads no regional list before pages load.
  ([`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml), [`policies.json`](browser/settings/distribution/policies.json))
- **Linux x86_64 releases built by this repo's CI**
  ([`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)), with sha256 digests. No PyPI or
  npm packages are published, and upstream's release train doesn't run. ([b70dc6c](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/b70dc6c52c1605ad8bcf7c7770cf99d2235dd8a0))
- **Cross-language LTO and PGO** with a pinned profile, as stock Firefox builds
  ([`ci/pgo.py`](ci/pgo.py)). A release is refused until a profile is pinned.
  Offered upstream in [#886](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/pull/886). ([3381943](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/3381943c57abebf06301bebee4e8f4a230781c44))
- **`canvas_noise` defaults to `False`:** the canvas is never covered.
  `canvas_noise=None` gives upstream's automatic cover. ([38ef536](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/38ef536579a3b1284929dfaf544dfb6e124a217e))
- **Stock-parity probe lab**
  ([`browser/tests/parity/`](browser/tests/parity)). It's a manual harness that
  diffs what a page sees in stock Firefox and in Camoufox, and it checks for
  leaks between contexts. ([9a9de49](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/9a9de495c1d223b7225ec4ee6eb05b0081b6968b))
- **Incremental local builds.** Prepared trees keep their object directory, and
  changed additions are synced without rewriting unchanged files. `make
  build-js`, `make build-cpp`, and strict `make verify-patches` reduce rebuild
  time without changing the release build.
- **Read-only PropertyTracer audit.** [`audit-property-tracer.py`](browser/scripts/audit-property-tracer.py)
  checks the 77 native source sites behind page-observable properties after a
  Firefox upgrade. It does not inject runtime tracing or shipping code. See
  [Property tracer source audit](docs/property-tracer-audit.md).
- **CI and the TypeScript launcher.** The TypeScript jobs don't gate merges,
  and the package install gate runs on upstream only. The TypeScript launcher
  is kept as upstream has it, but not every Python change is ported to it. ([f9e1994](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/f9e1994f29824bb0a58a192867e85fa7ba2cc5da), [6978636](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/commit/697863638dbaa4f2c16635f62e6ae0797fbc9a17))

## Building locally

The browser builds on Linux. From the repository root:

```bash
cd browser
make bootstrap                 # host packages and mach bootstrap, once
make dir                       # fetch Firefox, sync additions, apply every patch
make verify-patches compare=true
make build
make package-linux arch=x86_64
```

After editing Juggler, prefs, or copied resources, use `make build-js`. After
editing C++, use `make build-cpp`. `make sync` only copies changed additions
and settings. `make dir` preserves `obj-*` by default; use
`CAMOUFOX_CLOBBER=1 make dir` for a clean rebuild. The optional Docker build
can use sccache and persistent compiler-cache volumes without changing release
flags. Patch authoring and regeneration are covered in
[`docs/patch-upgrading-guide.md`](docs/patch-upgrading-guide.md).

## Installing

Each [release](https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free/releases)
carries a Linux x86_64 browser zip and its sha256. Install the launcher from
the commit the release tag points at, so the two agree about config
properties:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall "camoufox[geoip] @ git+https://github.com/coffeegrind123/camoufox-free.git@<release commit>#subdirectory=python"
```

Every commit reports the same package version, hence `--force-reinstall`.
Unpack the zip, check its sha256 against the release's `digest`, and point the
launcher at it:

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(executable_path="/opt/camoufox/camoufox-bin") as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
```

The launcher installs fpgen's model itself, pinned by URL and sha256. To
install it ahead of time, for example while building an image:

```bash
python -c "from camoufox.fpgen_model import ensure_fpgen_model; ensure_fpgen_model()"
```

`camoufox fetch` downloads upstream's browsers, not this fork's.
