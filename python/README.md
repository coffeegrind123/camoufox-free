# camoufox (Python)

#### The Python launcher for the Camoufox anti-detect browser.

</div>

`camoufox` drives the Camoufox browser through Playwright. On every launch it
draws a complete device identity from [fpgen](https://github.com/scrapfly/fingerprint-generator),
a model of real-world traffic, checks that the parts agree with each other, and
hands it to the browser, which spoofs it in C++. With a proxy and `geoip=True`
it also matches timezone, locale, geolocation and the WebRTC IP to the proxy's
exit IP.

The TypeScript package ([`typescript/`](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/tree/main/typescript)) is a port of this one
with the same options. Notes for AI coding agents are in
[`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/blob/main/AGENTS.md#using-camoufox).

## Install

```bash
pip install -U "camoufox[geoip]"
camoufox fetch
```

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.10 or newer |
| Playwright | below 1.63 (installed as a dependency) |
| `geoip` extra | needed for `geoip=`; downloads the [GeoIP All-in-One](https://github.com/daijro/geoip-all-in-one) database, refreshed once it is a week old |

`camoufox fetch` installs the browser build this release is paired with, and
fpgen's model, pinned by sha256. Without it, the first launch downloads both.
It reads the build's release with one GitHub API call and exits non-zero
when it installs nothing. On a shared CI runner, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise
GitHub's API rate limit.
Run `fetch` as the user that owns the Python environment if the browser will
run as someone else, for example while building a Docker image.
`camoufox remove` deletes everything that was downloaded.

## Usage

Camoufox returns ordinary Playwright objects, so existing Playwright code works
once the launch is changed.

### Sync and async

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(headless=True) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
```

```python
import asyncio
from camoufox.async_api import AsyncCamoufox

async def main():
    async with AsyncCamoufox(headless=True) as browser:
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://example.com")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Proxy with a matching location

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(
    proxy={"server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080", "username": "user", "password": "pass"},
    geoip=True,
) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
```

`geoip=True` looks up the exit IP through the proxy, then sets timezone,
locale, geolocation and the WebRTC IP from it. Pass an IP string instead to
skip the lookup.

### SOCKS5 proxy authentication

Playwright's pinned driver rejects SOCKS5 proxies carrying a username or
password before the request reaches Juggler. At launch, Camoufox removes those
credentials from the proxy passed to Playwright and supplies them through
`CAMOU_PROXY_CREDENTIALS` instead:

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(
    proxy={
        "server": "socks5://proxy.example.com:1080",
        "username": "<username>",
        "password": "<password>",
    },
) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
```

Credentials can also be embedded in the URL. Percent-encode `@`, `/`, `?`, `#`
and `%`; explicit `username` and `password` fields take precedence over URL
credentials. Both `socks5://` and `socks5h://` are accepted
case-insensitively, and `socks5h` is normalized to `socks5` before launch.
SOCKS5 endpoints must include an explicit port, even without credentials;
Playwright turns a missing port into `NaN` for Juggler.

For several endpoints, set the launch environment yourself. The JSON keys are
lower-case `host:port` strings, and an explicitly supplied environment variable
takes precedence over the mapping Camoufox would generate. The map is
browser-wide: all contexts using the same endpoint share one credential entry
throughout that browser's lifetime, and cannot override it per context:

```python
import json
import os

from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

credentials = json.dumps(
    {
        "proxy-a.example.com:1080": {
            "username": "<username-a>",
            "password": "<password-a>",
        },
        "proxy-b.example.com:1080": {
            "username": "<username-b>",
            "password": "<password-b>",
        },
    }
)

with Camoufox(
    env={**os.environ, "CAMOU_PROXY_CREDENTIALS": credentials},
) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
```

Without a proxy, sites can reach this machine over IPv6. IPv6 stays on when the
machine's IPv6 address geolocates where the IPv4 identity does. Otherwise, the
browser behaves as on an IPv4-only network, and a `LeakWarning` says why.

### Persistent profile

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(persistent_context=True, user_data_dir="profiles/alice") as context:
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
```

With `persistent_context=True` the context manager yields a `BrowserContext`,
not a `Browser`.

### One browser, many identities

`NewContext()` gives each context its own identity (navigator, screen, WebGL,
fonts, voices, timezone, WebRTC IP), applied through
`add_init_script` before any page script runs.

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox, NewContext

with Camoufox(headless=True, canvas_noise=True) as browser:
    alice = NewContext(browser, os="windows")
    bob = NewContext(
        browser,
        os="macos",
        proxy={"server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080", "username": "user", "password": "pass"},
    )
    alice.new_page().goto("https://example.com")
    bob.new_page().goto("https://example.com")
```

| `NewContext` argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `preset` | Use this fingerprint preset dict instead of an fpgen draw. |
| `os` | `"windows"`, `"macos"` or `"linux"` for the drawn identity. On a browser without canvas noise, the host's OS, and anything else raises `ValueError`. |
| `ff_version` | Firefox major version claimed in the User-Agent. Defaults to the browser's own. |
| `webrtc_ip` | IPv4 or IPv6 address WebRTC reports. |
| `proxy` | Per-context proxy, in Playwright's format. SOCKS5 credentials are not accepted here: Playwright cannot deliver them after launch. Declare authenticated endpoints in `CAMOU_PROXY_CREDENTIALS` at launch and pass only `server` here; otherwise `InvalidProxy` is raised. The context is placed where the proxy exits: `webrtc_ip`, `timezone_id`, `locale` and `geolocation` each default to the exit IP's, looked up through the proxy unless all four are given, and `InvalidIP` is raised if the lookup fails. |
| `geolocation` | `{"latitude": ..., "longitude": ...}`; also grants the `geolocation` permission. |
| anything else | Passed to Playwright's `new_context()`, overriding the generated value. |

`AsyncNewContext()` is the async twin.

Per-context SOCKS5 credentials fail closed before any geo lookup. To use
authenticated proxies in several contexts, declare their endpoints at launch,
then select one per context without credentials. Because `NewContext` performs
its exit lookup in Python, it cannot read `CAMOU_PROXY_CREDENTIALS` from the
browser environment. Supply all four location values in that case, as below, to
skip the lookup:

```python
import json
import os

from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox, NewContext

credentials = json.dumps(
    {
        "proxy-a.example.com:1080": {
            "username": "<username-a>",
            "password": "<password-a>",
        },
        "proxy-b.example.com:1080": {
            "username": "<username-b>",
            "password": "<password-b>",
        },
    }
)

with Camoufox(
    env={**os.environ, "CAMOU_PROXY_CREDENTIALS": credentials},
) as browser:
    alice = NewContext(
        browser,
        proxy={"server": "socks5://proxy-a.example.com:1080"},
        webrtc_ip="203.0.113.10",
        timezone_id="UTC",
        locale="en-US",
        geolocation={"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.006},
    )
    bob = NewContext(
        browser,
        proxy={"server": "socks5h://proxy-b.example.com:1080"},
        webrtc_ip="198.51.100.20",
        timezone_id="Europe/Paris",
        locale="fr-FR",
        geolocation={"latitude": 48.8566, "longitude": 2.3522},
    )
```

Use the actual exit location for each endpoint in real code. Omitting any of
`webrtc_ip`, `timezone_id`, `locale` or `geolocation` triggers a lookup, and an
authenticated context proxy passed without credentials will fail that lookup.

Canvas noise belongs to the browser, not the context (see
[The canvas on another OS](#the-canvas-on-another-os)). On a browser without it,
every context claims the host's OS and GPU too, since its canvas renders there.
Contexts with other OSes, like the ones above, need `canvas_noise=True`.

The browser's own OS also decides some things for all its contexts. A browser
launched as Windows on a Linux or macOS host (`os="windows"`, or drawn so)
computes `Math` as the Windows CRT does and uses Windows' keyboard shortcuts
(on a Linux host; on macOS only the editor caret style), middle-click and
scrollbars ([docs/HOST-PARITY.md](../docs/HOST-PARITY.md)).
Those are browser settings, so a macOS context on it has them too, and a
Windows context on a browser launched as another OS has the host's. `NewContext`
does not refuse the mix. Pass `os` at launch for the OS whose behaviour matters,
or use one browser per OS.

### The canvas on another OS

A page can draw a canvas or a WebGL scene and read the pixels back. Those pixels
come from the real OS, driver and GPU, whatever the identity claims.

- **On the host's OS**, the launcher starts the browser once, unspoofed and with
  the same display, reads the GPU Firefox reports, and the identity claims it.
  The pixels then agree with the identity. A host that renders in software (no
  GPU driver, as on most servers) keeps a drawn GPU: it reads as a machine
  whose driver failed to load.
- **On another OS, or with another GPU** (`webgl_config`, a preset's GPU, or a
  host GPU fpgen never recorded), the pixels would show the real one. Camoufox
  then turns on the canvas protection of `privacy.resistFingerprinting`, and
  only that:
  canvas and WebGL readback return random data, as in LibreWolf, Tor Browser
  and Mullvad Browser. Stock Firefox does not do this, so the launch prints a
  `LeakWarning`; the browser reads as a privacy-hardened Firefox rather than a
  stock one.

`canvas_noise=True` turns the protection on for any OS, `canvas_noise=False`
never.

WebGPU follows the same rule. `navigator.gpu` exists only where Firefox on the
claimed device has it (Windows and Apple Silicon Macs), and the adapter is the
host's only when the identity claims the host's GPU. Otherwise
`requestAdapter()` returns `null`, as Firefox does for a blocked or software GPU.

`gpu_passthrough=`True`` is for a host that renders on the claimed GPU under
another OS: a Linux container driving a Windows host's NVIDIA card through WSL's
d3d12 driver, claiming Windows Firefox on an NVIDIA GPU. The launcher reads the
driver's own renderer string (Firefox reports Mesa's d3d12 as "Generic
Renderer") and refuses unless it is a hardware GPU from the claimed GPU's
vendor. The canvas is then left uncovered, and WebGPU hands the page the
host's adapter; a Windows identity off Windows reports Windows' D3D12 adapter
limits (`webGpu:limits`) instead of the host backend's. Contexts of such a
browser claim the launch's OS and GPU.

### Headless modes

| `headless=` | What runs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `False` (default) | A normal window | Needs a display. |
| `True` | Firefox headless | Native headless WebGL/WebGL2 render on Mesa EGL and llvmpipe without `DISPLAY` or Xvfb on Linux; install the Mesa EGL/DRI packages from [`headless-webgl.md`](../docs/headless-webgl.md). |
| `"virtual"` | A headed browser on a private Xvfb display | Linux only, needs `Xvfb` and `setpriv` (util-linux). Handled by `Camoufox`, `AsyncCamoufox`, `NewBrowser` and `launch_server`. The display is 1x1 unless `CAMOUFOX_VIRTUAL_DISPLAY_SIZE` (e.g. `1920x1080x24`) says otherwise. Xvfb has no GPU: canvas and WebGL render in software. |
| `"virtual-gpu"` | A headed browser on a private, headless Xorg server bound to one GPU | Linux only, needs Xorg and the card's driver. Canvas and WebGL render on the card. Handled like `"virtual"`. See [The GPU display](#the-gpu-display). |

#### The GPU display

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(headless="virtual-gpu", gpu="0000:01:00.0", os="linux") as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
```

- **The card is named, never guessed.** `gpu=` (or `CAMOUFOX_GPU`) takes a PCI
  address, which is the stable choice, or an index in PCI address order, a
  render or card node (`renderD128`, `/dev/dri/card1`), `vendor:device` ids
  (`10de:2c02`) or a vendor name (`nvidia`). With several GPUs and no selector
  the launch raises `AmbiguousGpuSelection`; `GpuNotFound` and `NoGpuFound`
  mean what they say. `python -m camoufox gpu-xorg-config` lists the GPUs when
  the choice is ambiguous.
- **Without root, set the machine up once per card.** Xorg then runs through
  the setuid `Xorg.wrap`, which takes a config only from `/etc/X11` and needs
  `allowed_users=anybody` and `needs_root_rights=yes` in
  `/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config`. Stock Debian and Ubuntu ship
  `allowed_users=console`, which refuses a launch from ssh, systemd or a
  container. One command installs Xorg and the wrapper (with `apt-get`;
  elsewhere it says what to install), sets those two lines and installs the
  card's config. It is safe to run again:
  ```bash
  python -m camoufox gpu-setup 0000:01:00.0 | sudo sh
  ```
  A launch that fails for want of any of this ends its error with that
  command. The settings let any local user start a root X server.
  `gpu-xorg-config` prints just the card's config. As root, nothing is
  installed: a temporary config is used instead.
- **It leaves your desktop alone.** The server drives no monitor, shares the
  current VT and exits when the browser closes. If the active VT changes while
  it starts, the launch switches back, stops the server and raises
  `GpuVtTakeover`.
- **The launch checks the browser renders on the card.** A page draws WebGL
  and the launch waits up to 30 s (`CAMOUFOX_GPU_WAIT_S`) for the kernel to
  account GPU work to the browser. If it never does, the browser is closed and
  `GpuSoftwareFallback` is raised; `require_gpu=False` warns instead. There is
  no fallback to Xvfb.
- **The identity claims that card.** On the host's OS the identity claims the
  GPU Firefox reports, read on this display, so it is the card's and not the
  desktop's (see [The canvas on another OS](#the-canvas-on-another-os)).
- The browser gets `DISPLAY` and the X11 backend, and nothing that chooses a
  GL driver. These prefs default on, and `firefox_user_prefs` wins:
  `gfx.webrender.all`, `layers.acceleration.force-enabled`,
  `gfx.x11-egl.enabled`, `gfx.canvas.accelerated` and
  `gfx.canvas.accelerated.force-enabled`.

Every error here is a `VirtualDisplayError`.

### Remote server

Run Camoufox in one process and connect from any language Playwright supports:

```python
from camoufox.server import launch_server

launch_server(headless=True, geoip=True, port=1234, ws_path="camoufox")
```

It prints the websocket endpoint. Connect with
`playwright.firefox.connect("ws://localhost:1234/camoufox")`. A persistent
context cannot be served.

### Your own Playwright instance

`NewBrowser()` launches on a Playwright instance you already have, and
`launch_options()` returns the keyword arguments for
`playwright.firefox.launch()`:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from camoufox import NewBrowser, launch_options

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    browser = NewBrowser(playwright, os="linux", headless=True)
    browser.close()

    browser = playwright.firefox.launch(**launch_options(os="linux", headless=True))
    browser.close()
```

Prefer `NewBrowser()`: it also defaults new pages to `no_viewport` when the
window size is spoofed, and to the host's own color scheme and motion settings.

## Launch options

`Camoufox`, `AsyncCamoufox`, `NewBrowser`, `AsyncNewBrowser`, `launch_server`
and `launch_options` all take these keyword arguments. Any other keyword is
passed to Playwright's `firefox.launch()` (or `launch_persistent_context()`).

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os` | `str` or `list[str]` | fpgen's real-world mix | `"windows"`, `"macos"`, `"linux"`, or a list to pick from. |
| `headless` | `bool`, `"virtual"` or `"virtual-gpu"` | `False` | See [Headless modes](#headless-modes). |
| `gpu` | `str` or `int` | `CAMOUFOX_GPU`, or the only GPU | The card for `headless="virtual-gpu"`. See [The GPU display](#the-gpu-display). Not taken by `launch_options`. |
| `require_gpu` | `bool` | `True` | With `headless="virtual-gpu"`, fail the launch when the browser does not render on the card; `False` warns. Not taken by `launch_options`. |
| `proxy` | `dict` | none | Playwright proxy: `server`, `username`, `password`, `bypass`. SOCKS5 credentials are moved to `CAMOU_PROXY_CREDENTIALS` at launch; `socks5h` is normalized to `socks5`. SOCKS5 endpoints require an explicit port. |
| `geoip` | `bool` or `str` | none | `True` finds the public IP (through `proxy` if set); a string uses that IP. Sets timezone, locale, geolocation and the WebRTC IP. Without a proxy, also decides whether IPv6 stays on. Needs the `geoip` extra. |
| `geoip_db` | `str` | the `camoufox set --geoip` choice | GeoIP database name, e.g. `"GeoIP AIO by daijro"`. |
| `locale` | `str` or `list[str]` | from `geoip`, else the drawn identity's | Locale(s), e.g. `"en-US"` or `["fr-FR", "en-US"]`. The first is used for `Intl`. |
| `humanize` | `bool` or `float` | off | Human cursor movement. A number caps one movement at that many seconds (default cap 1.5). |
| `humanize_engine` | `str` | `"cursory"` | The generator behind `humanize`: `"cursory"` replays recorded human movements, `"mousecrack"` synthesizes them with a trained network. Needs `humanize`. |
| `screen` | `camoufox.fingerprints.Screen` | the real display when headed | Bounds the generated screen: `Screen(max_width=1920, max_height=1080)`. |
| `window` | `(int, int)` | generated | Fixed outer window size. |
| `fonts` | `list[str]` | none | Extra font families on top of the OS's own. |
| `custom_fonts_only` | `bool` | `False` | Use only `fonts`, not the OS fonts. Warns: the font set no longer matches the OS. |
| `addons` | `list[str]` | none | Paths to extracted Firefox addons (folders with a `manifest.json`). |
| `exclude_addons` | `list[DefaultAddons]` | none | Default addons to leave out, e.g. `[DefaultAddons.UBO]`. |
| `block_images` | `bool` | `False` | Block image loading. Warns: some WAFs detect it. |
| `block_webrtc` | `bool` | `False` | Disable WebRTC entirely. |
| `block_webgl` | `bool` | `False` | Disable WebGL. Warns: many WAFs check for it. |
| `webgl_config` | `(vendor, renderer)` | drawn | Use one GPU fpgen has recorded for Firefox on `os` (see `camoufox.webgl.firefox_gpus`); any other pair raises `ValueError`. An explicit pair replaces a preset's GPU. Needs `os`. |
| `canvas_noise` | `bool` | on for another OS or GPU | Random canvas and WebGL readback, as in LibreWolf. Warns. See [The canvas on another OS](#the-canvas-on-another-os). |
| `gpu_passthrough` | `bool` | `False` | The host renders on the claimed GPU's vendor under another OS (a Linux container on a Windows host's GPU through WSL's d3d12). Checks the host's GPU and raises unless it is hardware from that vendor; leaves the canvas uncovered and WebGPU on. Not with `canvas_noise` on or `block_webgl`. See [The canvas on another OS](#the-canvas-on-another-os). |
| `disable_coop` | `bool` | `False` | Turn off Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy so elements in cross-origin iframes (such as the Turnstile checkbox) can be clicked. Warns. |
| `main_world_eval` | `bool` | `False` | Allow `page.evaluate("mw:...")` and `mw:` init scripts to run in the page's own world. |
| `allow_addon_new_tab` | `bool` | `False` | Let addons open tabs. |
| `enable_cache` | `bool` | `False` | Keep Firefox's page and request caches. Uses more memory. |
| `pin_cpu_cores` | `bool` | `False` | Linux and Windows: pin the browser to as many cores as `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` claims, so a page timing parallel workers measures the same number. Costs CPU and serializes concurrent launches. |
| `fingerprint` | fpgen fingerprint `dict` | drawn | Use this fpgen fingerprint instead of drawing one. Warns. |
| `fingerprint_preset` | `bool` or `dict` | `None` | Opt into a recorded real-device preset instead of fpgen: `True` picks a random bundled one, a dict uses that one. |
| `ff_version` | `int` | the browser's own | Firefox version to claim. Warns: a mismatch with the engine is detectable. |
| `config` | `dict` | none | Raw Camoufox properties ([`properties.json`](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/blob/main/browser/settings/properties.json)). Overrides the generated identity; manual identity keys warn. |
| `firefox_user_prefs` | `dict` | none | Extra Firefox prefs. |
| `args` | `list[str]` | none | Extra browser command-line arguments. |
| `env` | `dict` | a copy of the environment | Environment variables for the browser. |
| `executable_path` | `str` or `Path` | the installed build | Use this binary. `CAMOUFOX_EXECUTABLE_PATH` sets it too. Raises with `browser`. |
| `browser` | `str` | the paired build | Launch another installed build: `"official/beta.20"`, `"beta.20"` or `"134.0.2-beta.20"`. Never downloads; warns like `camoufox set`. |
| `virtual_display` | `str` | none | Use an existing X display, e.g. `":99"`. |
| `i_know_what_im_doing` | `bool` | `False` | Silence the leak warnings above. |
| `debug` | `bool` | `False` | Print the config sent to the browser. |

`NewBrowser` and `AsyncNewBrowser` also take `persistent_context` and
`from_options` (a dict from `launch_options()` to use as is).

## CLI

`camoufox <command>`, or `python -m camoufox <command>`.

| Command | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch [VERSION]` | | Install the paired build (or, after `set`, the latest in the chosen channel), or `VERSION` without making it active. A named or paired build is read from its own release; anything else syncs first. Exits non-zero when nothing is installed. |
| `sync` | `--spoof-os auto\|mac\|win\|lin`, `--spoof-arch auto\|x86_64\|i686\|arm64` | Refresh the list of available builds from every repository. |
| `set [SPECIFIER]` | `--geoip`, `--release` | Pin a build (`official/stable/134.0.2-beta.20`) or follow a channel (`official/stable`). No specifier opens a picker. `--geoip` picks the GeoIP database instead; `--release` goes back to the paired build. |
| `active` | | Print the active build. A build that is chosen but not downloaded is marked `(not fetched)`. |
| `list [installed\|all]` | `--path` | List installed builds, or every available one, as a tree. |
| `remove [VERSION]` | `--select`, `-y/--yes` | Remove one build, pick one interactively, or (with no argument) the whole data directory. |
| `version` | | Package versions (Camoufox, fpgen, Playwright), the active build and whether it is the latest in its channel, the GeoIP database, and storage paths and sizes. |
| `path` | | Print the data directory (`~/.cache/camoufox` on Linux). |
| `test [URL]` | `--executable-path PATH` | Open a headed browser with the Playwright inspector. |
| `server` | | Start a Playwright server with default options and print its websocket endpoint. |
| `gpu-setup [GPU]` | | Print the root script that sets this machine up for `headless="virtual-gpu"` on the card `GPU` names (or `CAMOUFOX_GPU`). Run it with `\| sudo sh`. |
| `gpu-xorg-config [GPU]` | | Print the Xorg config `headless="virtual-gpu"` needs for the card `GPU` names (or `CAMOUFOX_GPU`). |

`set` and `fetch` read builds from these repositories (`repos.yml`):

| Name | Repository |
|---|---|
| Official | `daijro/camoufox` |
| CoryKing | `coryking/camoufox` |
| JWriter20 | `JWriter20/camoufox` |

### Which browser build is used

Each release of this package is paired with the one browser build it was built
and tested with. `camoufox fetch` installs that build and every launch uses it,
even when other builds are installed and even when the paired build is a
prerelease. A launch with the paired build missing downloads it first, so
upgrading the package never runs a browser it was not tested with.

`camoufox set` overrides the pairing. The choice is kept, and each launch warns
that the build differs from the paired one. `camoufox set --release` goes back.
The `browser` launch option overrides it for one launch, the same way: the named
build must already be installed, and nothing is downloaded.

Every browser release declares the interface it speaks, and the package refuses
one it cannot drive: `sync` leaves it out, `fetch` refuses it, and a launch
fails, each saying which package upgrade is needed. Once a sync has seen such a
build, every launch warns that the package needs upgrading.

A development checkout (installed from the repository, not from PyPI) is
paired with nothing and follows its channel, `official/stable` by default.

## Development

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r ci/requirements.txt -e 'python[geoip]'
.venv/bin/python python/scripts/pin-fpgen-model.py
.venv/bin/python -m ci.run_pythonlib
